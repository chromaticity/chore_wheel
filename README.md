## What Does This Application Do?
This application is geared more towards a group of people, but it can be used by a single user as well. With your group, you can all throw in tasks that need to get done for the day. However, if none of you can decide what actually needs to get done, then the group leader will click the button that will delegate tasks to everyone. Tasks will be delegated in a way that everyone gets as close to equal workloads as possible. Tasks are defined not just by their descriptions but by difficulty, and estimated time it takes to the complete the task as well. Group members can see in real time when their friends complete their tasks, and when new tasks are added.
## But Why?
It's more of a concept more than anything else. The product will work fully functionally, but it's also a showcase of what I am capable of doing. If people end up using this project for their own use, remember it's always free!
## Contributing
Of course you can contribute. Send a pull request over, or even clone the repository yourself and make your own improved task delegator!!
